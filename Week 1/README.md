# Lecture 1: C. IDEs, Compilers, Interfaces. Syntax and Rules in code.

## IDEs, Compilers, Interfaces.
IDE = Integrated Development Environments, allow us to write/run our code. Eg: VSCode

__Source Code (Code that we read/write) --(converted to)--> Machine Code (0s and 1s)__
Compilers are used to convert

__Terminals:__ provides CLI(command-line interface), allows us to compile, connects us to operating system(macOS)

## C:
hello.c
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```
Terminal:
> make hello
